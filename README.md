## 🎯 Overview

The Identity-Access-Review-System is a simulation tool built with Python. It helps organizations manage user access, ensure least privilege, and perform access reviews. This application goes beyond basic role-based authentication, providing a real-world scenario for how Identity & Access Management (IAM) and Identity Governance (IGA) systems work.

## 🚀 Getting Started
