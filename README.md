Identity & Access Review System (IAM / IGA Simulation)

Python, Tkinter, Identity Governance, Zero Trust

Designed and implemented a Python-based Identity & Access Management (IAM) and Identity Governance (IGA) system simulating enterprise-scale access control workflows.

Implemented RBAC with identity lifecycle management (Joiner–Mover–Leaver) including role changes, account disable/enable, and audit-safe state transitions.

Built TOTP-based MFA (RFC-6238 compliant) with account lockout after repeated failures, enforcing Zero Trust authentication controls.

Developed access review mechanisms to detect excessive privileges, high-risk entitlements, expired Just-In-Time (JIT) access, and Separation of Duties (SoD) violations.

Implemented policy-driven SoD detection and entitlement risk evaluation aligned with payroll fraud and privilege escalation scenarios.

Designed manager- and CISO-centric governance workflows, separating administrative actions from security oversight.

Integrated audit logging for authentication events, role changes, access modifications, and governance actions to support compliance and traceability.
